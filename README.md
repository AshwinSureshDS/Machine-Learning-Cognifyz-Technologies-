# Cognifyz Technologies Machine Learning Projects


## Overview

This repository contains four machine learning projects completed during my internship at Cognifyz. Each project tackles a different aspect of restaurant data analysis, from rating prediction to location-based clustering.

## Projects

### 1. Restaurant Rating Prediction

A machine learning pipeline that predicts restaurant aggregate ratings based on various features.

**Key Components:**
- Data quality assessment and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis to identify rating patterns
- Feature engineering for categorical and numerical variables
- Model comparison (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
- Evaluation metrics analysis and interpretation

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 2. Restaurant Recommendation System

A content-based filtering system that recommends restaurants based on user preferences and restaurant features.

**Key Components:**
- Feature extraction and engineering from restaurant attributes
- Similarity computation using multiple distance metrics
- Variance-based feature importance analysis
- Personalized recommendation function
- User interface for interactive recommendations
- Performance evaluation of different similarity methods

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### 3. Cuisine Classification

A multi-class classification system that predicts a restaurant's primary cuisine based on various attributes.

**Key Components:**
- Target preparation and class balancing techniques
- Feature engineering for categorical and geographical data
- Model training and comparison across multiple algorithms
- Hyperparameter optimization
- ROC curve analysis for multi-class classification
- Confusion matrix visualization and interpretation

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, imbalanced-learn

### 4. Location-based Analysis

A comprehensive geographical analysis of restaurant data using spatial clustering and visualization techniques.

**Key Components:**
- Geospatial data preprocessing and coordinate scaling
- Multiple clustering algorithm comparison (K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.)
- Advanced geospatial visualizations with interactive maps
- City-level statistical analysis
- Cluster interpretation and business insights
- Optimal cluster assignment for business decision-making

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Folium, Matplotlib, Seaborn, DBSCAN
